You'll need to check the particular policies of each publisher to see what is allowed and what is not allowed.

I am not aware of any university run participant pools.
At the universities I've worked in North America, human-subject studies (esp.
Apart from admission (which normally should not be related to age), there is something that's related to your question.
Age is not a PhD admission facor in the continental Europe, too.
This post refers to research in the STEM fields, and may not be applicable to other research topics.
This is about my experience in computer engineering I found that reading for breadth was the more important approach.
If you don't want to pay for Adobe Acrobat Pro, as @schultem mentions, LaTeX can do this with embedded hyperlinks.
If you don't mind hosting your files online, SlideShare is a good solution.
I don't think there are likely to be any standards that address this issue specifically.
You're going to find answers all over the map for this one (i.e., there probably aren't "standards").
My answer would be depending on which GRE are you referring to?
The problem I see with the GREs is that the scoring range is highly compressed.
If you have access to it, you can very easily do that with Thomson Reuters’ Web of Science portal.
You can have a look at the arXiv cultoromics website at http://arxiv.culturomics.org, which however searches in articles on the arXiv.
In general there are a number of different distinct workflows that lead to a poster.
For completeness, Apple's Pages has quite a few nice poster layouts.
It is perfectly okay to ask for the figure knowing well that the other person may not give.
You can always ask, then it is the choice of the author to accept or not.
The academic year does start around September in the USA and I think most European countries.
I would not accelerate things, to avoid getting worse grades that you want.
I will advise exactly the contrary of what bravo just said in another answer : go for A !
You could defer admission, but it's a little unusual to defer for a year.
Edit, again: The question seems to have changed, yet again.
I can think of three reasons why a faculty member might reveal how a student performed on a qualifying examination.
I agree with Seteropere completely, "Network Science" is a very broad subject.
I would say you are approaching it in the wrong way.
Supporting an ideology in an ostentatious manner (rather than privately or discreetly) is a personality problem.
I think for an appropriate answer I'd need to know exactly what the 'bad' ideology is.
This does not fully answer your question, but it is certainly one consideration.
I am a PhD student in Computational Science, which is an interdisciplinary major spanning mathematics, computer science, and engineerning.
A few possible problems: 1) Such an ID system seems a little intrusive.
In mathematics, we already have a database of this sort - two them, in fact, with in MathSciNet and Zentralblatt MATH.
As an complement to the other answers, let me address the question of why planets tend towards tidal locking.
The other answers here are fantastic at explaining in a technical sense.
Stars are rotating, but that's not the cause for their stability.
Stars rotate due to the angular momentum of the gas they formed from.
It indeed appears the Andromeda galaxy (M31) and The Milky Way (MW) are en route to a collision.
In a few billion years, the Milky Way and Andromeda will collide.
The short answer is: we are made from the "stuff" contributed by many stars.
It is highly unlikely that we're made out of stuff from only one star.
All we know is this : Distant objects are receding from us at a rate proportional to their distance from us.
The expansion of space means that objects in cosmological distances are receding away from each other.
Like Chris said above, stars rotate to conserve their angular momentum.
Stars are rotating, but that's not the cause for their stability.
According to this website the peak visible magnitude will be about 10.5 around February 2nd.
The AAVSO data seems to indicate that it might have already peaked, at around 10.5 (visual).
All of these effects are related to the 11 year solar cycle.
I will be specific to answering the part regarding the prediction of solar flares.
We are moving "... relative to the comoving cosmic rest frame ... at some 371 km/s towards the constellation Leo".
There is no 'still' that is not relative to some other object.
Yes, it's true that the apparent size of the Moon is 30 arcmin.
When you gaze at the moon "live", you are not seeing a still image.
Let us assume the data for a globular cluster to be equivalent to that of M13.
Globular clusters occupy an interesting place in the spectrum of composite stellar systems.
Why is the speed of light 299,792,458 m/s, and not (for instance) 3,1 or 4,3 x 10^44 m/s?
Speed of light being finite is one of the fundamentals of our Universe.
As per your definition, a star formed in a binary system (hence near some gravitating body) is a generalised planet.
The main flaw with your definition of a "generalised planet" would be the boundary between stars and planets.
A method used to calculate the distance between stars is 3 Dimensional trigonometry.
You only need two-dimensional trigonometry if you know the distances to the two stars and their angular separation.
The farther away, the faster the galaxies move away from us.
Here is my answer to a similar question posted on the physics stack exchange website.
Stars form in star-formation regions, which itself develop from molecular clouds.
It may be possible for a solar system like ours to exist outside of a galaxy.
A black hole (briefly), is nothing more than a dead star whose mass was more than 3 solar masses.
I think you mean to ask, "What is the local sidereal time of Greenwhich?".
Yes, but it does not stay in the same constellation.
Constellations are human constructs to make sense of the night sky.
Asteroids are what are called minor planets - small inner solar system rocky bodies.
The objects you are refering to are actually two different objects: asteroids and comets.
Here is a lexical decision task I wrote years ago using PHP and Javascript (github link).
Just for reference, I ended up writing simple web-based lexical decision task software myself.
It's pretty difficult to imagine a person with Social Anxiety Disorder being an extrovert.
On the surface, it does seem like social anxiety disorder and extroversion shouldn't both exist in the same person.
It is hard to delineate emotion completely from thoughts or sensations, because emotion can contain both.
Technically speaking, an emotion is not different from thought the way it is processed in brain, both involve neurotransmitters.
I've found an additional concept that may be related to the original question: prototype theory.
According to current models of human concept learning, the answer to your question is both.
There are individuals who possess extraordinary memory ability, sometimes called eidetic memory.
There are many arguments for why this is not the case.
Spike trigger is a specific type or you could say a sub-set of reverse correlations, covariance and probabilities.
There's the naïve version of spike triggered averaging, and the sophisticated version.
As mentioned in the other comments, ANOVA is problematic when mixing types of predictor variables.
I like to think of multitasking as rapid task switching.
Q: What is the reason for people to implicitly trust their peers in extreme (or not) situations?
One human-being reliance on other(s) awareness is defined by the level of trust between the humans.
Intrinsic reward is the emotional pay-off that you get by completing an activity.
According to Frederick Herzberg's two-factor theory of motivation, intrinsic rewards are motivators (e.g.
Presumably the decision of drivers to slow down in response to work zone signage is influenced by many factors.
This short talk deals with issues of "cheating slightly" :Dan Ariely: Our buggy moral code.
When studying adult IQ, general adult norms are often used.
Basically, what you do is you compare each age group IQ to the standardization sample.
Some ancient historical precedent exists for preferring $10$, but also for $6$, so that's mixed support from Wikipedia on perfect numbers.
This is indeed possible, but I haven't seen it done experimentally for reasons other than feasibility.
These are interesting studies, but the bottom line is: yes, environment affects cognitive abilities.
I'm not sure what you mean by cognitive capacity, but I absolutely believe that language shapes the way we think.
Since this is a relatively new problem for behavioral researchers, I don't know that there is a common consensus.
I'll address just the first of your three sub-questions, the others have been answered by Chuck Sherrington.
If non-human animals do have intelligence too, why is their intelligence not as advanced as humans?
Your own theory is bad because it seems to follow from a Lamarkian interpretation of evolutionary theory.
The Hare Psychopathy Checklist is often used to assess psychopathy in clinical settings.
From an article entitled Can You Call a 9-Year-Old a Psychopath?
I wrap steaks individually in freezer paper, then put them into ziploc freezer bags.
Wrap well in plastic (individually) and then put in a freezer bag.
In addition to oil, make sure the grill is nice and hot before you start cooking.
I'd been using paper towels to oil the grill, and I just discovered that newspapers work a lot better.
The best way I have found is to soak the ears in husk for several hours before grilling.
Soak whole ears in the husk in a bowl of water.
There are actually quite a few differences between the different types of flour.
The difference is the amount of protein contained in the flour which can range from 5% to 15%.
I've never adjusted the length of time based on number of eggs.
I don't boil eggs enough to keep a feel for the timing...
I just hold the cheese closer to the edge away from the grater.
By the wording of the question, I'm pretty sure you're using one of those pyramidal graters or a "sheet" grater.
I've stored pancakes in the freezer for over two month and not had any freezer burn.
Its going to depend on the type of packaging and also the freezer.
Break the bulb into cloves, breaking off the bottom and the dry stick that goes up the middle.
lay down a knife horizontaly on the cloves and hit it.
I managed to find this recipe, I think this is where I got the idea.
I've only made a couple of bbq sauces, but they've always come out really well.
I  believe one cannot taste the difference between minced(canned) and fresh garlic once it is cooked.
In my experience, fresh garlic is great for when you want texture, or to slow down the flavour infusion.
I grill salmon that I get with the skin on.
Salmon is a great choice and it's readily available pretty much everywhere.
The recipe I work from has you put the meat in the freezer, then pan sear it.
Starting with a whole chilled piece of meat, I quickly pour boiling water over all the outside surface.
They don't taste identical at all, and even more important, they don't smell the same.
Black pepper and white pepper are differing preparations of the fruit of the Piper nigrum plant.
This depends on the shelf life of the cultivar of tomato you purchased.
Tomatoes will last longer if kept in the fridge, but I actually recommend against keeping them there.
Coagulated egg proteins in combination with gluten give baked goods the supporting structure they need.
There are basically two types of cakes: butter and sponge (or Génoise).
A common one is haddock and is in season pretty much year round.
White fish are, as a rule, more delicately flavored than darker fleshed fish.
Good cheddar has little chunks of calcium lactate on/in it - could it be that?
I have two suspicions: One, you're undercooking your roux, the flour and butter mixture, and not fully incorporating the flour.
Copper can be useful for certain tasks due to the its metallic properties (heats quickly, distributes heat evenly, etc.
Probably subjective, but ... Good clad stainless steel will give you much better cooking performance per dollar than copper.
She obviously has a legit excuse, although she could have been more responsible and "have" told you in advance.
The first have covers both been more responsible and told you in that sentence.
In some cases the implication could even be that Tom does not love her.
There is no implication about Tom whatsoever in such a sentence.
I agree with others (and yourself) in that I have never heard this phrase in English.
I have never heard or seen the phrase you mention.
The assertion is false, at least as you've restated it here.
"I had mainly been" is fine, in the context you're using it.
I'd suggest you look to the constructions of the native language(s) of your students.
As bikeboy389 said, you can learn a lot by looking at students' native languages.
I see some references to status as uncountable as well, but that doesn't make much sense to me.
There are some cases "status" may be accounted of countable.
If I understand you correctly, you are looking for a hypernym of inclusion and exclusion.
Inclusion is the act of including and exclusion is the act of excluding.
Firstly, you should be aware that there are two different kinds of dashes: the en dash and the em dash.
Semicolon is used to join sentences that can stand alone, but are joined to emphasize their relationship.
Pardon the brevity of this answer, but I would say "named" is preferred within the context of your example.
Named is preferred in your example, since you are formally giving a name to your method.
In standard English, I think "don't got" has the same register as "ain't".
I'd say the expression I don't got... is generally rare in spoken AmE.
The "more posh" words are usually Latin (occasionally Greek) in origin.
As Shinto pointed out, vulgar words exist in every language.
I'm American, and I've never heard the bathroom referred to as St. John's.
In situations like these, I tend to lengthen out the phrase.
The room used for defecation is almost always referred to by euphemism.
I'm English, and would probably use 'toilet' most of the time, and always in the context of a private home.
I can only think of context using insofar as or insofar that.
The form insofar is American English; the standard form in British and other English is 'in so far'.
As others have said, "ten of six", though not used in many English speaking areas, would be understood as 5:50.
"Ten of six" probably means 5:50 but I have not heard it before.
Certainly many usage guides have advised against use of this "singular they" on various "logical" grounds.
Second one  (for writing purpose), if I believe the "THEY/THEIR (SINGULAR)" article.
This may be overly obvious, but in American English, saying "you're welcome" is certainly polite and standard.
I'm not sure how "Not at all" sounds in response to "thank you".
Back in the day, "cable" was used to describe communications sent abroad.
The word "cable" has its origins in the days of the telegraph.
Those expressions could have slightly different meanings especially when talking about finance.
I suspect the phrase originated in the habit of drawing the internet as a cloud shape on network diagrams.
In the United States, jails are operated by cities and counties (or equivalent).
Jail is a municipal level, prison is on a state/federal/provincial/territory level.
Yes, your sentence will be clearer if you write the actual word instead of the slash.
Most style guides recommend against using the slash in phrases like “X and/or Y”, as well as  “this is hard/impossible to do”.
If you understand yourself and your enemy, you will be far more likely to win any battle.
Another meaning behind this quote aside from probabilities of winning a theoretical battle is the importance of knowing/understanding others.
There are a lot of push up variations you can do and they all stress different muscle systems.
There are several different pushup variations out there and most of them provide a unique advantage.
You definitely do NOT want to be supporting your weight with your arms on the bike for normal riding.
No, don't support your weight on your arms Your hands simply aren't really made for supporting all that weight.
Yes, you should stretch before running, but not the sit down and reach kind of stretching.
Neuromuscular Activation and Dynamic Stretching Here is an excellent video on a dynamic stretching routine for running.
I feel your pain - I absolutely pour with sweat with any vigorous exercise, even in cool conditions.
Sweat rate is sweat rate, you can't really control it.
Running downhill is the BEST way to strengthen your quad muscles.
Additionally often people will think a downhill marathon is easier, but in fact, is often harder than an uphill marathon.
I recently stumbled on a great article that talks about protein consumption for the purposes of building muscle (recovery included).
Low reps with high weights don't add mass because the duration of the exercise is kept short.
Rotate through square, lunges and calf raises doing each until you feel a little burn.
Air squats, forward and side lunges, sprawl, wall chair, and lots and lots of jump rope.
If you're doing a full body workout 6 days a week, you absolutely need the rest week.
There are both physiological and neurological reasons to build in rest.
I've noticed a remarkable difference when I run on the treadmill vs when I run on the road.
A treadmill won't prepare you for the impact of running for real.
Google search for Travel WODs has whole lots of results which you can use.
As @Sarge says, this is for a doctor to diagnose properly.
Since you're being kind of vague here, I can only give you a vague answer.
In general, warming up your muscles only requires performing the movement with lower weights.
First of all, as a general matter of fact you suppose to change your workout routine in every 3-4 weeks.
You can mix those, but in my experience, it will be very difficult at first.
Properly executed weight training will increase, not decrease, your flexibility and mobility.
I've seen guys that are still very flexable while lifting weights.
I think it is still feasible to store seeds until the next year.
I haven't tried storing tomato seeds myself, but I have tried to store pepper seeds (and they are closely related).
It is not recommended to use greywater on vegetables that you will eat directly.
Adding soap to water allows the water to dissolve oils.
Yes, you can add coffee grounds with their filters to your compost pile.
Absolutely ok; we have incorporated coffee grounds into our plant food and many of those grounds included the paper filter.
There are no post-emergents that specifically kill crabgrass without killing lawn grass.
I brought an Ace product that kla crab grass and you can use it below 90 degrees.
Pick them as soon as they are as ripe as you want them.
I live in Delaware and have already harvested my jalapeno and chili peppers.
Thistle is classified as a noxious weed in most places and must be controlled.
I've got the same problem, where there are fields of dandelions just beyond the borders of my gardens.
Support is good for eggplants as the fruit may become heavy and can even break the branches.
Some support won't hurt, especially if it is a large fruited variety.
To paraphrase a common saying, "One man's weed is another man's lawn".
First, let me say I've no experience doing battle with Bermuda grass.
Just about anything can be grown indoors without natural sunlight.
We have quite a few people here who have grown peppers and small tomatoes indoors and in pots.
Chances are picking the seeds once it's gone to seed isn't going to actually encourage new growth.
The longer you can leave the seed-heads on the plant the better (IMHO).
So you know, I do not have personal experience with this.
Since you've already accepted a nicely sourced answer, I'll contribute some unsubstatiated tradition (i.e.
In the past it has grown almost like a weed in our pots on our deck here in North Texas.
Additional to the other answers, basil famously doesn't like to be damp overnight.
There is a very full description of the various types of hormone rooting compound here.
It is meant to stimulate root growth - in particular to stimulate the creation of roots.
I found it difficult to mark just one answer as correct because all are.
I reccomend "Monkey Grass" because it is like a slow growing weed that reproduces slowly and looks nice!
Simple answer is yes, flower shoots on lettuce is a sure sign of bolting.
It appears as though it has likely started to bolt.
Dirt can mean pretty much anything, from good to poor quality soil.
Use coco peat - It's an organic soil derived from coconut husks for garden vegetables and plants which is Eco-friendly.
If you can get over the "ick factor," you have an easily-applied source of organic nitrogen fertilizer close at hand.
The NPK numbers on the fertilizer represents the percent, by weight, of Nitrogen, P2O5 and K2O, respectively.
The point of aerating your pile is to get oxygen to the microbes that break down the organic matter.
Your pile will compost without turning it, but it goes faster if you turn it.
I bought a book, which talks about this, so here's an answer to my own question.
Well I wouldn't risk it, not in a cold compost system.
Aloes, like most succulents, are very hardy and will withstand considerable neglect .
Some of the guys at my office have potted aloe plants.
This looks a lot like an invitation to a No True Scottsman argument.
I concur with @T.E.D; the question is a "no True Scotsman" bar bet.
Some villages had histories and thus names going back to Ancient Roman times.
Many towns and villages took their name from the ruling family, the owners of the village.
The USA is the world's strongest country because of its military force.
The United States is one of the five largest countries in the world by area.
Nearly all countries grew quickly in the 1950s and 1960s for pretty much the same reasons.
The USSR growth rate during the 50's was not exceptionally high.
While Queen may refer to both Queen regent (sovereign) or Queen consort, the King has always been the sovereign.
There is a very good reason not to refer to the Queen's spouse as "King" - because they aren't the King.
To no extent at all is the wars in the middle east caused by trade making the area heterogeneous.
They had a treaty beginning in 1941, after a few skirmishes along the area in question.
"What I am really looking for is an estimation of the Muslim population..." @ThanosK and @T.E.D., an overall, general population estimation f.e.
The following is taken from my dog-eared copy of the New Penguin Atlas of Medieval History.
In Hinduism and Buddhism there is message of peace and an encouragement to not be materialistic.
This relates to the "discovery" of Asian, and other non-European cultures by Americans.
I guess those are greek tickets (εισιτηριον) for excavation sites or museums.
That is indeed Greek Looks like a Ticket to a museum or field.
These are tickets to the archaeological sites of Epidaurus (which includes the still in use theatre) and Mycenae.
I guess those are greek tickets (εισιτηριον) for excavation sites or museums.
Looks like you've rediscovered Jaspers's concept of the Axial Age.
There was no influence from China to the culture of Greece.
Yes, I can tell you from personal experience that they certainly did whistle.
It is true that bombs in World War II would make a whistling sound as they fell.
By the time that Qin had totally collapsed, Xiang Yu was China's hegemon.
The Han Dynasty came after the Qin Dyansty, after the government under Shi Huang Di collapsed.
There were indeed some serious issues surrounding Kennedy's election in 1960, one of the closest elections in History.
As per your original question: The  Wikipedia section does not claim that Joseph P Kennedy bought John F Kennedy's victory.
"The grass family is one of the most widely distributed and abundant groups of plants on Earth.
As noted on the Wiki page, grass seed was imported to the new world to improve pasturage for livestock.
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Delhi#Early_history shows that the city was called Delhi (or Dilli) at least since the 12/13th century.
I am not exactly sure but I remember the media (in India) addressing Delhi as "HASTHINA".
Dominus, plural Domini, in ancient Rome, “master,” or “owner,” particularly of slaves.
A greek-speaking slave (δούλος, doulos) I think would call his master κύριος (translit: kurios; lord, master, sir; vocative form: κύριε).
The bulk of India then was not controlled by Porus, but by the Nanda dynasty, centered at Pataliputra.
I believe Alexander lost heart after his horse, Bucephelus, died from a wound received in the battle against Porus.
Yes, this is true and yes, in most cases indefinite articles indeed developed from numerals, as @MGN already said.
Indefinite articles developed from numerals, and the definite articles developed from demonstratives.
Preserving grammaticality and preserving meaning of the sentence are two different things.
In fact, you can remove pretty much and preserve grammaticality if you don't care about preserving meaning.
In some nowadays Indo-European languages you can still see rests of base-20 numeral systems.
Modern Englishes, and many other well-known languages, use base 10 (ie decimal) systems of numerals.
The difficulty arises not from the various linguistic properties of the language pair as many here suggest.
It depends on generally syntactic structure of two languages and -yes- some pragmatic issues.
In English, certainly the most common use of do is Do-Support.
In traditional grammar, the word doing is a participle in all your examples.
A caveat: I'm experiencing the tail end of a three day migraine.
I agree with the commentators that your question is a little confusing.
The reason for this is that Russian is a much more tonal language than English.
Although I am quite fluent in Russian, I wouldn't say English sound particularly 'cold' to me.
Palatalisation of /k/ before front vowels happens all over the place: Russian, Greek, Turkish, Persian etc.
Sinhala, one of the languages spoken in Sri Lanka has a four way deixis system.
All the same methods of analysis that are used with spoken languages apply successfully to signed languages.
One idea that's been going around at least since the 80s is that you can distinguish between Holds and Moves.
Newspeak, a "deliberately impoverished" language designed to prevent people from communicating and thinking about subversive ideas.
Every language is permeated by the cultural values in which it is immersed.
In Russian, for example, animacy is not clear-cut in the distinction animate/inanimate.
As in Russian, Polish marks animate masculine nouns by having a genitive-accusative vs. the nominative-accusative of inanimate masculines.
As you can see from this map on the Wals.info site, there are many.
This is an example I always find is helpful for first year.
Zipf’s law, as I understand it, is not really about languages, but about statistics and probability.
As with all natural laws, Zipf's law is an approximation.
A part of the question thusfar unattended is whether the concept of phoneme has always been contentious.
"Phoneme" is a theoretical construct which probably can't go away.
If you arecomming from the non-linguistics environment, the best book is to start with Is Fromkin, Introduction to language.
This is what they recommend at Oxford as introductory textbooks to students starting a Masters' in Linguistics.
From what I'm seeing it's generally accepted that most English speakers have a vocabulary size of 15000 to 20000 words.
According to a statistical estimation I know roughly 7000 words in English.
A tent may give you slightly more protection than sleeping out in the open, but not much.
No, a tent will not give you any protection from bears that want what's inside.
A few points to add here: Coyotes are not know to be aggressive towards humans.
In general they are not considered dangerous because they rarely attack humans.
Nylon dries fast, is resistant to ripping and tearing, and fairly breathable.
Nylon, among other synthetics, is an ideal material for clothing for most outdoor pursuits for several reasons.
GPS (wikipedia) is based on orbiting satellites and so is accurate worldwide.
GPS systems can, and do, work everywhere you can get satellites.
Different parts of California have different wildlife, so you should probably narrow the region.
American black bears They are somewhat common in some wilderness areas of California, mostly in the mountains.
So it's important to have a basic understanding before you even get on skis.
Skiing is a sport where taking lessons pays off very quickly.
In a gym, the toprope will be wrapped over a cylindrical bar.
Alright, there are several different issues here that we must be sure to address.
I visit AZ every summer and include some hikes in the desert when I'm there.
Apart from what has been said, your need of water also depends on what you eat.
A wonderful woman I know has the Habenera bag by REI (link).
If you can settle on purple Nunatak and Feather Friends have good sleeping bags in those colors.
An embolism in a medical context refers to any large moving mass or defect in the blood stream.
Here is an interesting article on wikipedia to give overview of pressure related injuries.
It would be unusual for a snake to attack a stationary person.
I'm no herpetologist, but in my experience, snakes are in the "you don't bug me, I won't bug you" category.
As I wrote above, it's hard to rate this wall.
Unlike others, I think the route is pretty well described.
Once you open it up to toxins, the answer is clearly no, boiling is not enough.
Boiling eliminates only a certain class of contaminants that can make you ill.
Different parts of California have different wildlife, so you should probably narrow the region.
You can get a rough estimate from using an online calorie estimation website.
If you wear a bear bell on your backpack, your fellow hikers will kill you for being annoying.
The above advice is quite good, just wanted to add on thing to consider regarding food in bear country.
Oh friend, I have been down this miserable road just like you.
Yes, it is accepted practice to wash new Semi-Static rope (or Single Rope Technique/SRT Rope as it is known by cavers).
My opinion is to wait for the child to ask for it.
My opinion is to wait until the child itself expresses a desire for this.
You are safe to use the bottles as long as they have been properly sterilised.
I would say it's completely safe so long as the bottles have been adequately rinsed to remove any detergent residue.
He is taking the diaper off because he is uncomfortable.
You can try putting the diaper on backwards which may only work for a little while.
I would recommend asking questions in a way that doesn't require a yes or no answer.
Would you be concerned with the mind changing if he wasn't shouting and/or misbehaving?
Yes, twins can develop their own language, but it's not a given.
Here's what I saw with my fraternal twins: While learning to speak, all children develop some of their own dialect.
Whatever you do, don't bite him back to show him that it hurts.
We always lightly bopped our kids on the mouth, therefore showing him that his mouth is what hurt you.
A rule of thumb that I've heard is "for small children, big dogs".
Any breed of dog can be perfectly safe or extremely dangerous.
I know of no firm evidence indicating that baby talk is either helpful or detrimental in language development.
Baby talk, when used correctly is beneficial to speech development.
A possibility is to have a family meeting with the stated goal of working out the reward(s) for chores.
Many children, instead of being motivated by reward are motivated by being in control.
The point is to get the air out that the infant sucks into the stomach while feeding.
I've found with my baby that it's more accurate to go by his behavior than by "rules".
You should have a consultation route with the school head which can lead to direct consultation with a health professional.
It is always difficult when parents refuse to see what seems obvious to a teacher.
You will be hard pressed to find scientific studies that answer these questions with any certainty.
The topics you mention are very broad and not closely related in the scientific world.
Although cheese is very healthy and also good during pregnancy, some types might contain Listeria, which can cause serious problems.
As was mentioned, the problem with cheese is the potential for Listeria.
Both of our children slept in a portable pen for at least their first year, and there were no problems.
Yours looks like the one we used for my kids (same brand and everything).
I have never read anything that said teethers were bad--where did you read that?
We used a clean cloth or baby sock wrapped around an ice cube with our kids and grandkids.
I'm facing a similar situation; being Danish and living in (German-speaking) Austria.
An alternative would be to expose her solely or additionally to Hindi in daycare.
My son didn't become potty trained until about his 4th birthday.
Here are some things that worked with my son who started toilet training around 2.5 years.
Show her how much fun splashing is - that's what we did, and made a game of it.
You can put her toys near her or give he toys to her.
Our daughter has always loved her bath, but coming out... not so much.
My wife and I originally had the same problem with our newborn twins fussing when bath time was over.
Playing doctor is something all kids want to try at some point.
I have been in a simular situation with my daughter and a female friend when they were 5 and 4.
Most doctors do recommend rice cereal as the first food, as there is almost no worry of allergic reaction.
Eating off a spoon has to be an unusual experience for them.
Most of the literature I can find about infant sleeping has to do primarily with waking habits, not eating habits.
In my experience, babies tend to wake up by themselves when they get hungry.
Here is my advice based on my personal experience pumping breastmilk for twin boys for a full year.
I understand that the first 3 days are the most important, so much so it is vital you do it then.
It is possible, but it will have to be a docile female betta and a bigish tank.
We tried putting a male betta in a community tank once.
Turtles love eating goldfish and lots of things that fit into their mouths.
First, the turtles are eating the fish because fish are food, not friends.
Given that the amount of shedding is normal, I don't think there's anything you can do to lessen it.
To reduce the amount of fur a cat malts over your furniture and clothes you could try a deshedder brush.
My experience with Danios has that they always have been "bossy" fish.
Breed Zebra Danios are extremely hardy fish, they are almost difficult to kill.
I have seen cats not like using the litterbox for a variety of reasons.
I think Keltari has some good ideas.... A cat can change its "taste" in litter material.
Cats (and all animals in general) do not understand the concepts of order or tidiness.
They don't intend to leave those items around the house or untidy the house.
It does sound like your cat is upset about something, and trying to communicate it to you.
Something is bothering your cat and he does not like it.
I have noticed most cats don't lick people a great deal.
Cats may or may not lick a person based on all kinds of things.
How could be you so sure that the fish died a natural death.
In my 200 L fresh water tank, which is an aggressive tank, fish occasionally get harassed to death.
First, double-check the dog's body language to make sure that it is truly aggressive.
First, you should realize that this is not you or your dog's problem.
The appropriate pH level of the water does vary a bit by fish, but too acidic can definitely kill them.
The info you've been given in the previous answers is good.
My guess is that means your cat only marginally likes the food you're feeding him.
Some researchers believe domestic cats never really mentally grow up completely and they always look at you like their mom.
Cover the entrance to the doorway with a old carpet and use a staple guns to secure it.
I started to dig into this because you caught my curiosity itch with the question...
Try switching to rats; weanling rats if you need something smaller.
As mentioned in previous answers, rats and gerbils can be offered instead of mice or in a rotation with mice.
You should take this animal to a vet right away.
As covered in the other answers, your only option is to see a vet in order to have surgery done.
The main cause of the allergies is proteins in the saliva.
Allergies to animals, particularly furry ones, can be across the board rather than species specific.
There are a few things to help your bun gain a bit of weight.
John Cavan has some reasonable and appropriate methods for increasing a rabbits weight in his answer.
Stocking is very subjective to the specific inhabitants as well as the setup and your aquarium experience.
You'll always want to add fish into a tank slowly.
The best approach is play with your cat each night in the evening before bedtime.
A trick I did was to grab and hold my cats close if they disturbed me during the night.
I don't have direct experience with bettas, but I've never heard that pairs will work long-term in any male/female combination.
Bettas are highly territorial and no matter what sexes you keep together they will fight.
We always put it crushed up in a bit of butter or on a sardine.
We had a cat that required daily medication, and it was a struggle to give the cat a pill.
The biggest reason I can think of is that you're taking away a defence mechanism for the cat.
Cats don't usually like to have their paws held, touched, or anything like that.
Breed Zebra Danios are extremely hardy fish, they are almost difficult to kill.
Supposedly Danios need to school which mean you need at least 5-8 Danios in your tank.
Clean the urinated zone with vinegar (I used to do that when my feline daughter was a baby kitten).
Others have made some good suggestions about how to neutralize the odors in the area.
Aristotle didn't put the world at the center of the universe per se.
Why did Aristotle place the earth at the centre of an infinite universe?
I don't think that positivism is a position of mostly leftist philosophers.
I am not convinced that positivism is routinely asociated to a leftist ideology.
Well for one a being could have a non-physical existance and yet not even be in your mind.
The difference is huge, as not all non-physical things exist in minds.
People who are good at the philosophy of mathematics are mathematicians and not philosophers.
My motivation is that I like to look at things from their roots and go up.
The difference between "necessary" and "sufficient" is the direction of the logical arrow.
sufficient is an upper bound, necessary is a lower bound.
I have no idea why it is voted up, but Rex Kerr's answer begs the question.
It's a tautology, but the mapping between logic and the English-language description is wrong.
It's true that, under one understanding of "accessibility" and "determining", your accessibility relation is determined by your axioms.
Accessibility is determined by the axioms of the modal logic you're working within.
I once met a physicists who held the strong AI position.
Although I believe Searle is mistaken, I don't think you have found the problem.
If a statement is not provable an inconsistency or self-contradiction may or will develop that invalidates the system.
Should arrival at this point be the focus for examination of any system?
The Question is (from Hinduism); do you exist because of pregnancy?
The least that can be said is that we must be born with the ability and 'knowledge' to learn.
I think that for an understanding Wittgenstein's "solution", you must take in account the original (historical) context.
Wittgenstein is alluding to how Russell himself solved the Paradox - the theory of ramified types.
Forget for a moment that you ever learned anything about so-called "complex" or "imaginary" numbers.
As others have already mentioned, numbers are of course abstractions.
The question of time is an incredibly difficult one, which has been treated of philosophers from Aristotle to Heidegger.
wikipedia, as much as it is a supposedly self correcting medium, is not necessarily a definitive account of anything.
Not all negative claims can be validly reformulated into positive claims.
I don't think the burden of proof is on positive or negative versions.
As I understand it, nothing that can be changed, or broken down into smaller parts is inherently real.
Our interactions are merely depends on where we put our perception.
I can imagine a scenario where a single all powerful god create the universe that we know of.
It is the same idea as what Aristotle called the unmoved mover.
When I needed a travel tripod, I also opted for a Trekpod.
An alternative tripod that may serve your needs is the TrekPod.
Fast Picture Viewer has an extensive pack for the low price of $9.99 and it appears to cover them all.
Fast Picture Viewer is $9.99 and works just fine on 64-bit Windows 7 (I'm using it myself).
There are many compact cameras with underwater housings available from Canon and Olympus.
There are waterproof compacts that go to 10 meters, such as some of the Olympus Tough models.
Apart from aperture and focal length, depth of field also decreases with camera-subject distance.
The wider your aperture, the smaller your focal depth will be.
When printed on a lens the f-stop is usually expressed as a ratio with a colon (i.e.
It refers to the maximum f-stop (which is defined as the ratio of focal length to effective aperture diameter).
You need to be embedding a color profile in you image, as also using a browser that supports color management.
In my experience, when the final production will be in sRGB, use that color profile from start to finish.
I have a few Nikon lenses, and a Sigma 10-20mm for super-wide shots.
If your interest is primarily the optics, you need to look at individual lenses, not brands as a whole.
I have found there is no single best way to increase size.
There are a very wide variety of solutions for resizing and sharpening images for use on the web.
I've used Paint Shop Pro and DxO Optics Pro on Windows.
In Linux I use Bibble, which is has some warts but which is the only serious option AFAICT.
A class 6 card in theory should be more than enough bandwidth for HD (1080) video for the 550D (48 MBit).
Some cards are too slow to accept an HD stream, so you need one that is fast enough.
Here are many samples: Pbase.com Out of the 16k photos there, I'm sure some are with a d700.
It's a 1:1 lens, so that means that the size of the subject will be the same size on the sensor.
Same here, I've the 50mm f/1.4, and as my fastest lens I couldn't live without it for concerts and low-light photography.
I have the 18-55, 50/1.8 and 50/1.4 as well as the 20D - superseded by a 50D.
I use Elinchrom Skyports, but if money is not an issue then go for PocketWizards.
Or just go with the ultra-cheap YongNuo RF-602, which give you a lot of bang for the buck.
The short answer is that yes, you can do this.
Speaking from my own experience, I would rather carry different ND filters that combine two polarisers.
The terminology is usually called "Destructive vs Non Destructive" editing.
Lossless / nondestructive edits are reversible and would entail transforming and/or appending the data in a way that could be reversed.
